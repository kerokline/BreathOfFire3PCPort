# Handoff — next session

**Status:** IN PROGRESS (2026-09-19)

[`STATUS.md`](STATUS.md) says where the project stands. This file is what to
pick up, how, and the traps already paid for. It **points at evidence rather
than restating it**.

**Maintenance rule: rewrite, do not append.** At the end of a session, replace
the sections below so they are true *now*. No dated banners stacked on top of
old paragraphs, no "the claim above is withdrawn" — the sibling's handoff
accreted that way and became hard to read. History belongs in `git log` and in
the investigation docs; anything durable moves to `STATUS.md`.

## Where things stand in one paragraph

Phase 0 is done and stage 1 of the owner's order of work
([`STATUS.md`](STATUS.md)) is under way: a launcher injects our DLL into the
player's `BOF3.exe` and **twenty-five functions are ours** - `LoadDatFile`, the
eight-function file layer (DIV-0003), `Save_WriteFile` (DIV-0002),
`Gfx_BeginFrame` (DIV-0004, a crash fix), and fourteen faithful ones that make
up the image path from the rendered-frame flushes down to the texture-cache
invalidation (`src/game/gfx_*.cpp`). The A/B switch, a call tracer, a crash
reporter and a shadow check against clones of the originals run in-process;
the attract oracle, three memory-dump regions and the frame hash all pass
original-vs-ours. See [`STATUS.md`](STATUS.md) - do not expand this paragraph
into a second copy.

## Pick up here

The single next action, concrete enough to start without asking anyone.

1. **Replace what the attract sequence reaches** - stage 1. The image path
   is ours down to the texture cache's lookup, and the cache entry's layout is
   complete ([`asset-loading-path.md`](asset-loading-path.md) §2). What is left
   of it all talks to Direct3D: the lock wrapper `0x5A3CC0`, the entry builders
   `0x5A0080` / `0x5A0510` (ten COM calls each), the glyph-texture lookup
   `0x5A2BC0` (128 entries of 0x14 bytes at `0x7C9F50`, keyed by glyph and CLUT,
   same generation trick), and the 3.7 KB set-up `0x5A5160`. **Decide first how
   such a function gets checked** - a clone can run it, but its product is a
   surface, not memory; reading a locked surface back is the obvious candidate. [`IDEAS.md`](IDEAS.md) I14 lays out
   three levels of image check; its level 1, a display-list hash, is small,
   needs no Direct3D, and is also what the text swap wants.
   That decision is the real next piece of work on this path. The cheaper
   alternative is to leave the path here and turn to logic: regenerate the takeover queue (`python tools/calltrace.py queue`,
   [`call-trace.md`](call-trace.md) §9 - it predates tonight's thirteen) and
   work it from layer 0, hottest logic functions first. The recipe that has
   worked thirteen times is under "How to run things".
2. **Owner, in game: [`USER_CHECKS.md`](USER_CHECKS.md).** The converted saves
   are done bar one item. Still owed: a save and load through the fully-ours
   file layer, DIV-0003's failing case, DIV-0002's clean A/B. New and optional:
   play with `BOF3X_SHADOW=Gfx_InvalidateTextures` set and look for `MISMATCH`
   in `build/bof3x.log`; and anywhere the game scrolls or copies VRAM, or
   shows a compressed picture, is the only live test there is of
   `Gfx_MoveImage`, `Gfx_MoveCells` and `Gfx_UploadLzss` - the attract
   sequence reaches none of them.

## Then

Ordered; reasoning lives in [`STATUS.md`](STATUS.md), not here.

3. **[`IDEAS.md`](IDEAS.md) I12 - let the game run unfocused.** Asked for by
   the owner because every check tonight took the PC away for minutes. The
   mechanism is read (app-active byte `0x6BC63B`); it is a divergence when
   built. Worth doing early: it makes everything in item 1 cheaper.
4. **Prepare stage 2, the text swap.** The attract sequence's text boxes run
   the in-game dialogue engine ([`attract-mode.md`](attract-mode.md) §6), so
   there is already a regression check. Unmeasured: which of `MsgBox_Step`'s
   23 control codes those eight messages use (tracer detail mode), and
   nothing covers `Msg_OpenSystem`. What the swap *is* is the owner's to say.
5. **[`IDEAS.md`](IDEAS.md) I13 - save states**, the oracle for what the
   attract sequence cannot reach (menus, system text, combat - stage 3). First
   experiment is written there.
6. The first **receipt**, and a CI job that at least compiles `src/`
   ([`STATUS.md`](STATUS.md) open decisions). The evidence a receipt would
   record now exists in three forms: `attract_diff.py`, `mem_dump.py
   --compare`, `calltrace.py frames`.
7. Finish reading the asset path: the `SND\`/`BGM\` loaders `0x587910` /
   `0x587A20`, the drive-root probe `0x5A72C0`'s caller `0x4FCB50`, the 32
   callers of `LoadDatFile`, the value-sequence search for the dropped PSX
   sections ([`asset-loading-path.md`](asset-loading-path.md) §4). For I1,
   save interchange: the PC block builder `0x5806F0` and the options bytes at
   block `+0x78`; PC-to-PSX is still static only.
8. [`known-defects.md`](known-defects.md): D1, clipped stat numerals, wants its
   A/B run and the draw path read; D3, fullscreen fallback, is unreproduced;
   the frame deadline kept in a 32-bit float is a small, player-visible fix.

## How to run things

_Commands a fresh session needs, verified on the date above._

- **Build:** `cmake --preset i686 && cmake --build build` — llvm-mingw's
  `i686-w64-mingw32-clang++` is already on `PATH` on this machine (the
  `retcomm` toolchain under `~/.local/share`), **not** the MSYS2 one.
- **Run:** `build/bof3x-launcher.exe --game bof3`; log in `build/bof3x.log`.
  Original behaviour for one function or all: `BOF3X_ORIGINAL=File_Read` / `=*`.
  **Windowed:** put a two-line `BOF3.CFG` (`0`, then `1`) in the game
  directory, or press F8 in game ([`windowed-mode.md`](windowed-mode.md)) —
  recommended for agent sessions, since it avoids the display mode-set.
  Without it the game mode-sets to exclusive fullscreen for the FMVs; from an agent
  session, end it with `taskkill //F //IM BOF3.exe`.
- **Regression check (10 min, hands off the game window):**
  `python tools/attract_run.py --out analysis/attract/ref.tsv --original "*"`,
  the same without `--original` to `new.tsv`, then
  `python tools/attract_diff.py ref.tsv new.tsv` — exit 0 means identical
  `Rand` count, message and area at every frame
  ([`attract-mode.md`](attract-mode.md) §6).
- Saves: `python tools/save_convert.py list CARD.mcr` / `info` / `psx2pc` /
  `pc2psx` — usage in the file's docstring. In Git Bash pass Windows-style
  paths (`cygpath -m`): a `/c/...` path inside a `CARD:SLOT` argument is not
  translated.
- **Byte-level check of a loader:** start `python tools/attract_run.py --out
  analysis/attract/tmp.tsv --minutes 2.4` (add `--original NAME` for the
  reference), and within a few seconds `python tools/mem_dump.py --label X`;
  then `python tools/mem_dump.py --compare A B`. Always take two reference
  runs — the pair is the noise floor.
- **Shadow check:** `BOF3X_SHADOW=Gfx_InvalidateTextures`, `=Gfx_TexCacheFind`, `=gfx_clut`, `=gfx_flush`, `=gfx_unpack`, `=gfx_vram_ops` or `=*` before the launcher
  or `attract_run.py`; `shadow` lines in `build/bof3x.log` — a start-up
  self-test line, then a running tally every 256 calls
  ([`SCAFFOLDING.md`](SCAFFOLDING.md) §2).
- **Takeover recipe** (each of tonight's thirteen): read the function to its
  last instruction, quirks included; `symbols.toml` entry with the evidence
  and `impl`; implement, keeping every unchecked edge and saying so in the
  comment; if every jump stays inside it, clone it and fuzz ours against the
  clone at start-up under `BOF3X_SHADOW`, then break ours on purpose and see
  the fuzz refuse to run; live, all ours: `mem_dump.py --compare clutref_a X`,
  `attract_diff.py orig_a.tsv X.tsv`, and the frame hash before a merge; say
  in the doc what none of that reached; one commit per file of functions.
- **After a crash:** `CRASH` lines in `build/bof3x.log`, then
  `python tools/crash_report.py` ([`crash-reporter.md`](crash-reporter.md)).
- **Call trace:** [`call-trace.md`](call-trace.md) §8.
- DAT containers: `python tools/dat.py survey ../bof3ext/bof3/DAT` (expect
  742 clean); `list` / `extract --out analysis/dat/<name>` / `compare <DAT> <EMI>`
- Fixtures check: `python tools/verify_fixtures.py`
- Ghidra: `python tools/ghidra_pc.py import` (paths in `CLAUDE.md`)

## Traps already paid for

_One line each, with a pointer. Add when something costs more than an hour._

- BSim produced one high-confidence wrong match; no BSim name exceeds
  `hypothesis` without a PC-side read ([`bsim-evaluation.md`](bsim-evaluation.md)).
- Indexing PSX overlays into the BSim database degrades published ranks unless
  done on a copy ([`overlay-transfer-feasibility.md`](overlay-transfer-feasibility.md)).
- Figures repeated across docs are not evidence — count them (the 29,036 case,
  same doc).
- A Python `'''` string or a bash heredoc silently eats backslashes — two
  generated files came out wrong this way. Write source files with the editor
  tools, and keep backslashes out of `symbols.toml` evidence strings (TOML
  basic strings treat them as escapes).
- The game freezes whenever its window is not the foreground window, then
  replays the missed time unrendered ([`windowed-mode.md`](windowed-mode.md)).
  Any unattended observation must foreground it first; `attract_run.py` does.
- `attract_run.py` re-takes the foreground for the whole run, so **anything the
  owner types goes into the game** and one keypress ends the attract sequence.
  An oracle or hash run needs the keyboard and mouse left alone entirely, not
  just the game window (lost a run to this 2026-09-19).
- A rebuild fails at link with "Permission denied" while a game launched
  through the launcher is running — it holds `bof3x.dll` open. Close the game.
- `pe_xref.py` answers "who touches this *data* address". It does not index
  calls: "(no references)" for a function means nothing. For callers use
  `callees` in `analysis/pc_funcs.json`, or scan `.text` for E8/E9 rel32. Cost
  one wrong "no caller" claim, caught the same day.
- `mem_dump.py`'s `clut` region and `attract_diff.py` are both unreliable
  under `BOF3X_CALLTRACE_MODE=all` - the first depends on run speed, the second
  miscounts frames at half speed - and both "fail" with every function
  Capcom's. Dumps and the oracle at full speed, the frame hash under the
  tracer, never mixed ([`asset-loading-path.md`](asset-loading-path.md) §2).
- One disagreeing frame from `attract_diff.py`, at a state change, is a torn
  sample until a re-run says otherwise; the frame hash is the arbiter
  ([`attract-mode.md`](attract-mode.md) §6).
- `--original "*"` inside an unquoted `$(...)` or an `echo` is glob-expanded:
  `attract_run.py` dies on the file names, and the `cp` after it then saves the
  PREVIOUS run's `build/bof3x.callframes.tsv` as this run's. Check the
  `inject:` line of `build/bof3x.log` says what the run was meant to be.
- Pairing EMI sections to DAT chunks by order or by address mis-pairs 47
  files; use `dat_census.align` ([`DAT_CONTAINER.md`](DAT_CONTAINER.md) §2).

## In flight / uncommitted

_Branches, open PRs, half-finished experiments, files in `analysis/` worth
keeping. "Nothing" is a valid entry._

Branch `phase-3/gfx-loadimage`, cut from `main` at `cee66ad` (PR #3, phase 0).
Everything is committed and pushed, and a PR against `main` was opened at the
end of the 2026-09-19 session; if it has merged, start the next branch from
`main`. It holds the `mem_dump.py` drain wait and `clut`
region, the shadow check (`bof3::CloneOriginal`, `BOF3X_SHADOW`), thirteen
takeovers (fourteen with `Gfx_TexCacheFind`) in `src/game/gfx_image.cpp`, `gfx_texcache.cpp`, `gfx_clut.cpp`,
`gfx_flush.cpp`, `gfx_unpack.cpp` and `gfx_vram_ops.cpp`, and IDEAS I12 / I13.
One commit's message describes doc changes that landed in the commit after it
(`49738b7`, then the docs); harmless if the PR is squashed.

Local only, gitignored, worth keeping:

- `bof3/BOF3.CFG` (windowed mode); the owner's PC saves `bof3/BISLPS00/01/0F.DAT`
  and the two converted ones, `02` (JP) and `03` (US).
- `analysis/attract/orig_a.tsv` - the all-original reference for
  `attract_diff.py`; `ours_d_fileopen.log`, behind
  [`attract-mode.md`](attract-mode.md) §7.
- `analysis/memdump/clutref_a_*` and `clutref_b_*` - the all-original reference
  pair for `mem_dump.py --compare`, all three regions (`drain_a` / `drain_b`
  are the same without `clut`).
- `analysis/calltrace/ab3_orig/` - the all-original frame-hash reference,
  recorded with twenty-four owned and still identical with twenty-five: owned
  functions are left unarmed, so it survives a takeover only when the function
  was not in `entries_logic.txt` to begin with (`Gfx_TexCacheFind` is
  render-timed and was not). Taking over a *logic* function changes every
  frame's hash; re-record then, about five minutes.
- `analysis/memdump/slowref_*` - an all-original dump taken under the tracer,
  the evidence that the `clut` region depends on run speed.
